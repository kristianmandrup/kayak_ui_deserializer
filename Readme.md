# Kayak UI deserializer

Deserializer for [kayak UI](https://github.com/StarArawn/kayak_ui), a Bevy ECS UI engine.

## Goal

The current goal is to deserialize a JSON file into Kayak UI structures that can be stored in a Hashmap for reference. This allows the Game UI designer to externalize some UI decisions as Game "assets" that can be loaded from file.

## Status

Still fleshing out the internal functioning and structures. The focus so far is on parsing and building up Kayak UI structs.
